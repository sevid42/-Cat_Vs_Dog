# Cat_Vs_Dog
This is a simple convolucional Network to clasify Dog and Cats, was took from "https://machinelearningmastery.com/"

I have try it on Google colab, but as there are so much images is really slow (6 hours) ->https://colab.research.google.com/

I recomend to buy a good computer to make image processing or use another technique as SVM.
